# og:me: a Chrome extension

### Download a webpage's `og:image` in just two clicks

**og:me** lets you quickly download the image that is defined in the `og:image` tag of a webpages's HTML.

TO USE:

1. Click the **og:me** Chrome extension icon ![og:me icon](images/19.png) when visiting any webpage
2. Click on the displayed image in the preview box to download it

This <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/og:me/kkhddppbaabnelnahdndgjhiddnbchbo" target="_blank">Chrome extension</a> should be particularly useful for social media editors and managers who want to streamline the process of grabbing a social-optimized image off any article page so that the image can then be uploaded onto another social platform. **og:me** also shows a preview of the current `og:image`, so you can see how well-optimized that image is for social sharing.

If no image is defined in the `og:image` tag, no image preview will appear---so if it's in your power you should, you know, fix that.  

Note that the image will be downloaded to the destination defined by the user's Chrome settings, which usually defaults to the *Downloads* folder.
