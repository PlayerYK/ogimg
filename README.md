## a Chrome extension

Download a webpage's `og:image` in just two clicks.

**ogme** lets you download the image that is defined in the `og:image` `meta` tag of a webpages's HTML, in just two clicks. This <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ogme/kkhddppbaabnelnahdndgjhiddnbchbo" target="_blank">Chrome extension</a> should be particularly useful for social media editors and managers who would like to streamline the process of grabbing the social-optimized image of any web article, where the image can then be uploaded onto another social platform. **ogme** also has the added benefit of allowing you to preview the current `og:image`, so you can see how well-optimized that image is for social sharing.

To use:

1. Click the **ogme** Chrome extension icon ![ogme icon](images/og16.png) when visiting any webpage
2. Click on the displayed image in the preview box to download it

If no image is defined in the `og:image` `meta` tag, no image preview will appear&emdash;so if it's in your power you should, you know, fix that.  

Note that the image will be downloaded to the destination defined by your Chrome settings, usually defaulted to your `Downloads` folder.
